In the north, just below the peaks, where [[The Rootways|mangrove roots]] spiral down to the depths below, the Locathah are longer limbed and spend a majority of their time above water, mostly relying on the pools of brackish water which form in the bromeliads and canopies of the roots to catch their breath. This subspecies relies on the fruits of the mangrove, and the large predatory water bugs as their primary source of food, and have developed a sophisticated art culture centered around arrangements of petals and dyed fabrics found in the jungle around them.
