### Custodians of The Pools
If any race could be considered true natives of [[The Tidepools]] , The Locathah would be those people. Appearing mostly as ambulatory mudskippers and catfish, the Locathah are a hardy group of hunter-gatherer tribes with rich and vibrant cultures connecting to the area of The Tide Pools they call their own.

### Specialized and Secure
Owing to the diversity of environments they inhabit, the culture and appearance of Locathah vary greatly depending on where in [[The Tidepools]] one finds them.

Within the interior of [[The Tidepools]], throughout [[The Terraced Cliffs]], [[The Motai Locathah]] journey about, spreading life across the various hot springs and tidal basins that make up the central island

In [[The Rootways]], [[The Kattil Locathah]] swing from branch to, worshipping the great trees and anemone which sustain their way of life

Within the [[The Lower Pools]], [[The Kukai Locathah]] form permanent settlements and live off of the detritus floating down from above.

Across [[The White Coast]], [[The Karayorim Locathah]] frolic and relax in the warm sands and shallow waters, living a relatively carefree life compared to other denizens of [[Evertide]]
