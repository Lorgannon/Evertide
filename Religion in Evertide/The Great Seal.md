Stories of the ancient past flavor the practices of the hard-working [[The Orcs|orcs]]. According to their cultureâ€™s history, the tides which constantly batter the shores of [[Evertide]] are the result of an ancient rift deep in the core of the world. They also hold that their god, [[Malkar]] works constantly in their afterlife to seal the breach to the wrong side. As such, [[The Orcs]] work daily, honing their skills in the forge so that upon their death they may assist [[Malkar]] in the construction of the blockade. [[The Goblinoids]], in a slightly different reflection of these core beliefs, believe in the breach at the core of [[Evertide]], but instead believe that [[Malkar]] simply needs entertainment and distraction as he works, thus they devote themselves to the arts.
