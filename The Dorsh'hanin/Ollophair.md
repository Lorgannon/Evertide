### The Primal Deep, Wrath of the Reef
[[The Deep Black]] and [[The Sea Beyond]] are well known for their abundance of beasts and monstrosities. Ollophair is the lord of those beasts. Depicted most often as a faceless humanoid with the lower half of an octopus, or as a massive angler fish, Ollophair is empowered by the expansion of his domain. The greater the ranges for his beasts to roam, the more they may feed and reproduce, and from their ravaging, the more creatures may be forced to revert to their bestial habits. Most cultists of Ollophair are beasts themselves, [[Krakens]] and [[Dragon Turtles]] who put Humanoids under their thrall to serve their dark purposes. Humanoid worshippers of Ollophair tend to be [[Hybrids]] and [[The Tieflings|Tieflings]] who find themselves isolated from civil settlements and turn to the beasts that other races insist they already are. These followers exist almost as monsters of folklore, returning to the towns they were banished from to feed upon those who scorned them, casting fear and despair before eventually bringing the settlement to a bloody end.
