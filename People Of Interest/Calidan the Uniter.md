Calidan is the leader and founder of [[The Nascent Shore]]. After being orphaned by a rogue wave which destroyed most of his childhood fleet, he and the other children of that doomed voyage banded together to form a new community with what little vessels remained. Together, these lost children sailed to the Mangrove Swamps at the top of the world and found a largely inhospitable wasteland, as well as [[The Tortles|Tortles]] who would actively shun them, and the closed-off walls of [[Pourewa Tike]]. Hardened by these rejections, they would begin to sail around the plane, picking up other survivors and growing both in influence and in manpower.

Over the years, as he added more people — and ships — to his community, he began to crave a more permanent settlement for his people to call home. As even more time passed, and as his relationship with [[Santiana]] developed, this craving developed into a more salient plan to find[[The Humans|Humanity]] its own place on [[Evertide]]. After a night of perhaps a bit too much wine, the two would begin to turn their desire into a plan of action. A movement devoted to molding [[Evertide]] into a place they could finally call home.
