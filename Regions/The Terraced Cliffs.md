Composing the bulk of The Tide Poolsâ€™ interior, The Terraced Cliffs can mostly be described as a textured mass of volcanic stone walls, connected by various geological features such as land bridges, geysers, small volcanoes, and tidal lakes. Working in congress, these outcrops create the series of terraces that the cliffs are named for. Most of the flora and fauna of this region are heavily adapted to the constant tidal force that the cliffs are subjected to, either having developed robust root systems and strong, flexible stalks in the case of plants, or an amphibious lifestyle with tough exoskeletons or pliable, hard-to-tear skin in the case of animals. Along the tops of the cliffs, where the environment is slightly less susceptible to the whims of the tides, more permanent niches have formed, creating space for anemones, sea jellies, and larger, more sedentary fish.
