The Tidepools are most likely the only livable isle in the entirety of [[Evertide]]. During times of low-tide. The entire, continent-sized island peaks above the seas, revealing the deep, glass-like canyons of [[The Terraced Cliffs]], and ventilating the great, twisted thickets of [[The Rootways]]. At high-tides, The Pools disappear almost entirely under the waves, only [[The Mangrove Swamps]] peeking above the vibrant waves. 

The Tidepools are divided into 6 distinct regions (arranged from highest to lowest altitude):
[[The Mangrove Swamps]]
[[The Rootways]]
[[The Terraced Cliffs]]
[[The White Coast]]
[[The Blue]]
[[The Lower Pools]]
