Formed from the crushed remains of seashells, coral, and [[The Tidepools]] themselves. The white sand beaches of [[Evertide]] mark the barrier between the land which breaches the waterâ€™s surface, and that which stays perpetually beneath the waves. Besides the massive species of Clam and Mussels that are the main food source of the local [[The Karayorim Locathah|Kayorim Locathah]], various species of crab and cephalopod can be found here, as well as the [[Canine Nudibranch]], a popular hunting companion among the humanoid races of the tide pools. While exposed to air, The White Coast is one of the safest areas for humanoid life, boasting almost constant warm sun, easy hunting and foraging, and relatively few threatening predators. During high tide, however, the coast becomes a hotspot for the most dangerous of deep water predators. Brought on by easy meals, creatures like deep-sea morays, cephaladons, and even young Kraken are known to encroach on these normally tranquil shores.
