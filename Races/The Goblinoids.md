#TerrestrialRace
### Eclectic Artisans
Despite being wildly unsuited to the world they find themselves in. Goblinoids, a massively dimorphic species consisting of hobgoblins, bugbears, and goblins, have largely tried their best to make the most of a rough situation They construct floating villages from gas-filled seaweed bunches and coral pieces across [[The White Coast]] and [[Pheydren's Domain]]. They also create great art from the detritus that makes its way to the surface, and have developed a rich cuisine from the various flora and fauna they have been able to hunt. and of the terrestrial races, their cultures seem to be the most in tune with [[The Great Torrent]], providing a greater supply of wizards, sorcerers, bards, and druids whose magic further enhances their carefree lives.
