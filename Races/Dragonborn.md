### Sultans of the Deep
Tall and broad, with crests of webbed fins sprouting from their heads and backs, Dragonborn boast some of the most intimidating builds on [[Evertide]]. Dwelling in [[The Lower Pools|the deep chasms]] that divide the many peaks of The Tide Pools, The Dragonborn live much as their draconic ancestors once did, in underwater caves, alone and surrounded by what precious metals and gems they can collect. Despite their proclivities for the accumulation of wealth, Dragonborn are not greedy and most will freely give wealth to those who are hardy enough to journey down to the depths of [[Evertide]]. Outside of those who dwell in the deep dark, solitary Dragonborn may be found closer to the surface, swimming through the [[Pheydren's Domain|open ocean]], taking mercenary jobs on behalf of [[The Triton|Triton]], and engaging various water beasts in open combat, what exactly drives each of these lone warriors is unknown. Whatever the reason behind their struggle is, they are often among the most capable warriors to be found in the region.
