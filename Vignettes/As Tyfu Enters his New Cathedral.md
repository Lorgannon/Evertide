The first thing that hits you is the smell. You've grown used to the stench of your own rot, the low-tide, rotten fish aroma that clings to your shell and sinks into whatever fabric crosses your path. But this is new. It crashes over you like a wave of hot syrup, viscous and heavy with moisture and raw... aroma. As your nostrils acclimate to this new kind of air, you become aware of the actual contents of the room. To call it a room is perhaps too generous, it is a hallway, at most 5 feet wide, made more narrow by the shelves of tightly packed waste. Your guide holds a cloth soaked in perfume over his nose and mouth, eyes watering from simply being in the chamber. 

**"This 'ere is where we grow our grub  — er — grubs"**

Overwhelmingly, as you gaze over the wriggling piles of shit, packed tightly in this center of progress and hope for the terrestrial peoples of The Tidepools. You cannot shake that, more than whatever meager idols you stitched together in your hut so long ago, more than the blinding, alabaster cathedrals that line the floor of The Blue, this tiny closet is fundamentally a place of true worship, a guarantee that no matter how separated these *people* think they are from the pull of decay, no matter how they convince themselves that they have somehow escaped the rot, it is still with them, and they still tithe to it, consume it, and eventually, as you notice finger bones and teeth among the filth, join it.
