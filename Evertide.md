Drifting about within the elemental chaos of the Astral Sea, caught on an astral current (known locally as [[The Great Torrent]]) is a small, disc-shaped plane known as Evertide.

Owing to its near constant proximity to the elemental plane of water, Evertide is covered by a nearly uninterrupted ocean, whose tides ebb  often enough to allow only the bare minimums of terrestrial life to scrape by. Life on Evertide is dangerous, not only due to the tides, but also the wealth of sea monsters, both magical and mundane, that call Evertide home.

Regardless of the hazards abound, Evertide is a home to a wide variety of cultures and creeds, each of which has managed to carve out its own niche into the surrounding environments.
