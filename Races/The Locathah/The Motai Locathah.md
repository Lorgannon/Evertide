The most populous tribe to be found on [[Evertide]], the Motai make their home on [[The Terraced Cliffs]] and interiors of The Tide Pools. They feed primarily on the algae and invertebrates which inhabit the pools at low tide, and as such find themselves moving from pool to pool during high tide, depositing the larvae and seedlings from their previous pools to maintain the cycle of regrowth. These [[The Locathah|locathah]] have a culture centered on druidic practices, and their village elders are unique in their ability to tap into the life energy of the world around them to perform miracles separate from [[The Great Torrent]].
