Far at the peak of [[The Tidepools]], where even the greatest
tidal swells just barely reach, a lush forest of giant mangrove
trees grows, bustling with life. Among these massive trees sits
an ecosystem unlike any other in [[Evertide]]. Flocks of seabirds
nest in the canopies, feeding on the vast array of fruits and
nuts offered by the dense canopy. Gigantic alligators crawl
through the silt and clay which gathers in the roots, and large
herbivorous aurochs feed peacefully on the algae and fungus
endemic to the region. Beyond the varied wildlife, The Mangrove
swamps host [[Evertide]]â€™s only terrestrial plant life, a fact
which the humanoid denizens of the swamps use largely to their
advantage, with [[The Tortles|Tortles]] crafting their longboats from the
enormous fallen branches of the mangrove and [[The Orcs]] of
[[Pourewa Tike]] using the biomass of the forest to power their
great forges.
