### Shunned Abominations
Beings of constant flux, Hybrids are the change of Evertide incarnate. Mostly coming about from terrestrial species such as [[The Orcs|Orcs]] or [[The Humans|Humans]], Hybrids are born with significant physical mutations such as massive claws, wings, or gills. The actual origins of individual hybrids are hotly debated among the shamans and scholars of [[Evertide]], [[The Triton|Triton]] lore argues that theyâ€™re abominations created by [[The Humans|humans]] as a form of forced evolution. The more paranoid among humans believe them to be infiltrators from [[The Deep Black|the Deep]] or even from Tritons who may wish them ill. Vedalken scholars meanwhile believe that they represent the terrestrial species finally becoming one with [[Evertide]] and making it their home. It is this belief that drives [[The Tortles|Tortles]] to shun any hybrids born in their midst and exile them to the blue. Even hybrids themselves have no knowledge of their origins as most living today are three to four generations removed from their species introduction to the tidepools. Due to the distrust held for their race, most Hybrids live in small family units, or in the case of those who do not have relatives, communes of ten or less.
