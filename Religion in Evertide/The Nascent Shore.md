Founded by [[Calidan the Uniter]], The Nascent Shore is a relatively recent movement by [[The Humans|Humans]] to establish their own homeland within [[Evertide]]. The specific goals of The Nascent Shore beyond "finding a home" are relatively vague, but [[Calidan the Uniter|Calidan's]] charisma has done a well in uniting a significant number of humans behind his cause. Some factions within Evertide have begun to regard The Shore with a measure of concern that they may become imperialist, conquering the homelands of the [[The Orcs|Orcs]], [[The Tortles|Tortles]] or [[The Vedalken|Vedalken]] in a quest to create their own niche.
