### Emissaries of The Blue

Among [[Pheydren's Domain|the coral reefs which surround The Tide Pools]], Sparkling cities of quartz and limestone dot the ocean floor. Within these cities, the noble Triton make their home. Supposedly descended from [[Pheydren the Great|Pheydren]], a mythical personification of [[The Great Torrent]] of [[Evertide]], Tritons are dedicated to the protection of [[Evertide]] and as such spend much of their time guarding the various wellsprings of primal energy that erupt from the ocean floor, as well as performing research and reconnaissance into potential incursions by entities like [[The Dorsh'hanin]]. In preparation for this guardianship, Triton youths are often stationed alone on lesser valued points of interest as a kind of rite of passage before shouldering the responsibility of guarding the entire reef. Triton settlements most often form on the ocean floor centered around the higher value of their artifacts. These settlements, often called protectorates, are more akin to military bases or religious compounds than traditional cities, with all production and labor being focused on maintaining the seals and guardships around that particular artifact. Notable protectorates include [[Karucustium]], where a portal to the Deep Black was sealed by [[Pheydren the Great|Pheydren]] many millennia ago, or [[Rayalamna]], the birthplace, and eventual burial site of [[Pheydren the Great]].
