### Builders on an Unfriendly World

The Orcs of [[Evertide]] have found themselves in a unique position. Despite their status as an air-breathing, land-walking species, their great strength, and powerful lungs have lent them something of an edge against their fellow terrestrials, allowing them to found the only permanent settlement on the surface of Evertide. Deep in [[The Mangrove Swamps]] on [[The Tidepools]]’ peak, the sandstone walls of [[Pourewa Tike]] lend shelter to all within their borders. In this bastion of the air breathers, Orcish craftsmen work their forges, creating magnificent tools, armor, and weaponry that rival the projects of even the most devoted [[The Triton|Triton]]. This sanctuary, however, is highly guarded against outsiders, and aside from those born within its walls, few are allowed to even glimpse the wonders within. Beyond their presence at Tide Pools’ peak, Orcs can be found all over the island, whether breaking bread with [[The Goblinoids|hobgoblins]] in one of their various floating settlements or even enchanted with water-breathing and learning crafts from [[The Triton|Triton]] or [[The Locathah|Locathah]].
