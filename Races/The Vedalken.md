### Cliffside Spiritualists
On the [[The Terraced Cliffs|interior walls of The Tide Pools]], built into the cliffs and cave walls of the wave-battered coast, a race of stout, blue-skinned amphibians make their homes. Utilizing their amphibious physiques and nimble hands, the Vedalken have managed to carve out a niche for themselves in this ever-changing world and build a self-sufficient life farming seaweed and anemone during high tide, as well as beets and glasswort (sea pickles) during low tide. As a species on the brink between water and land, subject constantly to the will of the tides, the Vedalken have developed a [[The Unsung Path|philosophy of growth and change]] that has pushed their culture to become one of the most academically adept species in all of [[Evertide]]. No other race has a better understanding of the natural forces that govern life in the pools.
