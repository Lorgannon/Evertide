### The Crushing Deep, The Lower Jaw of Evertide
The majority of the known [[The Dorsh'hanin|Dorsh'Hanin]] work solely as independent entities, not interacting with each other's spheres of influence at all. However, due to the fear of terrestrial races of being trapped in Evertide, Gialaghain and [[Neamhní]] have a special connection among the Dorsh’Hanin. Together, the two form the upper and lower jaws which entrap [[Evertide]] in a state of eternal claustrophobia. On her own, Gialaghain is a force to be reckoned with as well. She is the cramped spaces of [[The Deep Black|the Deep]], tight magma tubes, narrow ravines. Most often, she manifests as complex networks of tunnels that trap her victims and drive them slowly to madness. Her cultists mostly worship her by facilitating these traps, leading wayward souls, and sometimes even entire tribes of [[The Kukai Locathah|Kukai Locathah]] into her demiplane to be digested slowly.
