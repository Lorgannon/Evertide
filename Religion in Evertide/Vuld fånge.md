### Prisoners of the World
[[The Tortles]] of the great swamp have the unique gift of long life. With life spans often reaching one and a half thousand years, the eldest among them are only one or two generations removed from their species introduction to [[Evertide]]. As such, they have a unique perspective on the nature of [[Evertide]]. They see the world as something of a prison or at the very least an accidental trap, collecting whatever detritus washes up from the Astral Sea. [[The Tortles]] believe themselves, as well as [[The Humans|Humans]], [[The Orcs|Orcs]], and [[The Goblinoids|Goblinoids]] to be among that “detritus”, unfortunate prisoners of a hostile world. Believing that they are destined to be constant outsiders of the world they inhabit, [[The Tortles|Tortle]] doctrine dictates that they must never find themselves settling in one place in the [[Evertide]], as they must be ready to leave when the chance arises. What awaits them when they do leave [[Evertide]] is subject to much debate. The staunchest of elders preach that the other side will be a paradise for Tortles, that they will enter into a golden age, and build cities to rival [[The Triton]] of [[Pheydren's Domain|the Blue]]. Skeptics and disruptors among them, those who have truly grown into the endless travel they are born into, argue that it is much more likely that the next dimensional portal will bring them to a world that will be just as alienating, if not more, and that instead, their nomadic lives are to prepare for the endless change that curses their people.
