The laid-back Karayorim Locathah can be found frolicking in the shallow coves and lagoons which ring the [[The White Coast|outer edge]] of the tide pools. This tribe enjoys a relatively easy, peaceful existence feeding on the massive shellfish that make their homes under the sand. Due to their easy living, the Karayorim tend to focus most of their time on maintaining a rich culture of athletic excellence. As such, the Karayorim are among the most capable swimmers in the entirety of [[Evertide]], and those that make their way out of their ancestral homelands often become couriers for organizations such as the Nascent Dawn or Pheydrenâ€™s Creed.
