[[The Triton]] myths say that, long ago, before the ages of man and goblin, a great darkness clutched the shores of [[Evertide]]. Unknowable horrors crawled up out of [[The Deep Black|the Abyss]] and terrorized what small villages existed on the seafloor, beings never meant to be seen by the light of day blotted out the sun and nearly drowned [[The Tidepools]] in their savagery. For centuries battles raged, until, as a final resort, [[The Great Torrent]] itself manifested a warrior, a being of great power who fought back the dark, imprisoning it deep behind cold marble and banishing those who would not be imprisoned to the abyss far below [[The Tidepools]]. After his victory, the warrior, now known as [[Pheydren the Great]], founded a nation of capable fighters to protect the seals and other magical artifacts of [[Evertide]]. [[The Triton|Triton]], as the descendants of this great nation, have an ancestral duty to carry on his legacy, and shelter [[Evertide]] from what lies beyond and what lies beneath. All other species are, varyingly, people to be protected, or threats to be eliminated. At the current state of [[The Tidepools]], most species fall in the former category, with growing tension towards [[The Tortles]] and the humans due to their insistence not to adapt, as well as the [[Hybrids]] for their anomalous nature. However this animosity is not distributed on a species-wide, or even settlement-wide level, rather the most fervent “protectors” of [[Evertide]], have become increasingly wary of those who do not share their creed.
