Homeland of the Triton, Pheydrenâ€™s Domain refers to the 200-mile radius around [[The Tidepools]] which remains permanently underwater no matter the state of the tides. This area, while completely submerged and sometimes hundreds of feet deep at low tide, remains relatively warm, and for the most part hosts only the mundane variety of predators (reef sharks, thrashers, giant turtles, etc.). It is due to this relative hospitality that most larger Triton settlements are built in this region.
