[[The Nascent Shore]] found Ysolde when she was just sixteen, babbling on a floating chunk of driftwood just off the edge of the [[The Terraced Cliffs]]. Over the days following her rescue, she grew more and more coherent, largely thanks to the care of Arthur Merrigen, the chief medic of [[The Nascent Shore]] at the time, who doted on her and helped her to feel safe.

Once she had gained some semblance of function again, Ysolde became more or less normal, attending to the laundry and other cleaning duties necessary across the fleet, Ysolde became something of a fixture of the crew, and her blossoming romance with her once caretaker was a source of hope for many of the more jaded citizens of [[The Nascent Shore]].

Just two years after her rescue, Ysolde and Arthur were married, a simple affair officiated by [[Calidan the Uniter|Calidan]] and attended by the sparse crew of the fleet. Together, the two would conceive the first child of [[The Nascent Shore]], an even brighter beacon of the good fortunes they were certain were on the horizon.

But it was not to last, two months before the birth of their son, [[Terryn]], [[Arthur Merrigen|Arthur]] was caught in an ambush by [[The Triton|Triton]] radicals and killed, leaving a pregnant Ysolde alone with their child. After the loss of her husband, Ysolde began to recede back into old habits, sleeping at odd hours, locking herself away during meals, and making herself scarce from an social interactions.
