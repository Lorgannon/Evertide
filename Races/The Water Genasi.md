### Children of the Tide
Due to [[Evertide]]â€™s position directly above [[The Great Torrent]], it is not uncommon for the powerful elemental energies of the Torrent to concentrate upon an individual en utero and produce a being who is significantly more attuned to the flow of the elements than even the average [[The Triton|Triton]]. Easily identified by their slightly translucent blue skin, these children are often great boons to the tribes or settlements they are born to, and beyond their natural abilities to control water, they are considered to be good luck and a sign of a blessing from whatever deities their culture worships. (similar things can be said of fire and air Genasi although their powers differ in obvious ways).
