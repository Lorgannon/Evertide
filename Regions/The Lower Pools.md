 The Lower Pools is the deepest area considered to be habitable by most species. At this depth, most life has been specifically adapted to live at depth and in the dark, the bioluminescent lures of viperfish provide some of the only natural light, and the common occurrence of underwater caves means that large, supernatural predators are common. Despite this danger, The Lower Pools are also home to both the extremely accepting [[The Kukai Locathah|Kukai Locathah]], a people dedicated to the protection of those who otherwise would be cast to [[The Deep Black|The Abyss]], and at the border between the Pools and the Abyss, a collection of marine [[Dragonborn]], lords of the deep, freely offer wealth to those bold enough to ask.
