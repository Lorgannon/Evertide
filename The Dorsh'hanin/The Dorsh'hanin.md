A loose pantheon of various, mildly conflicting entities of great power. Each of whom holds some sort of interest in the swallowing up of the remaining isles on [[Evertide]] and the total annihilation of anything that is not of that deep, ancient dark. They are largely worshiped by the [[Merrow]] and [[illithids]] of the deep waters beyond the reefs of The Tide Pools, certain shamans and learned humans believe that some if not all of the entities may have been the products of the ancient [[Kuo-Toa]].

While there has never and may never be a complete and comprehensive list of the Dorsh’hanin, there are a few whose interactions with [[Evertide]] are common enough that they have been given names and developed followings

[[Neamhní]], The Void Above
[[Duibheagán]], The Blind Abyss
[[Gialaghain]], The Crushing Deep
[[Lobhadh]], The Falling Rot
[[Ollophair]], The Primal Depths
[[Buitachta]], The Yellow King
