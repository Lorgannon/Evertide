Often shortened to just “The Black” or “The Abyss”, This region is the subject of much concern to the [[The Triton|Triton]] and [[The Vedalken|Vedalken]] scholars who study it. Despite all their arcane and practical knowledge, none seem to be able to determine the exact nature of the region. On first observation, the area seems to be far too dark, and due to this, it is one of the few areas of [[Evertide]] where one can immediately recognize that they have entered it. Besides this anomalous darkness, The Abyss contains the highest concentrations of magical beasts in the entirety of Evertide and is even home to creatures not found anywhere else in the deep waters of Evertide. Beyond scholarly concerns, the Shamans of the Motai and the Goblinoids, both races who have no history of contact with The Deep Black, telltales of dark forces who work from beneath the heart of Evertide, laying plans and biding time to meet their vicious ends.
