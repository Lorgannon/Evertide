### Descendants of [[The Dorsh'hanin|The Black]]

Less a culture of their own, and more a result of random mutations in the other species of [[Evertide]], Tieflings, or the Dorsh-Duine, are rumored to be the results of a bloodline which ties back to the old gods of [[The Deep Black]], or even the direct results of rituals and cults intended to extend their reach into [[Evertide]]. Duine often have features that reflect their abyssal lineage such as slick, translucent skin, long needle-like teeth, tentacled appendages growing in place of hair, webbed hands and feet, or bioluminescent pits under their eyes and along their forearms. Due to both their appearance and the circumstances related to their birth, Duine are exceedingly rare. Those that are born in proximity to settled areas often find themselves targets of harassment and suspicion, often leading to their eventual demise, or, rarely, their turn to worshiping [[The Dorsh'hanin|the beings]] which brought them into existence.
