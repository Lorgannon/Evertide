[[The Vedalken]] are a curious race. Embedded in the walls of [[The Terraced Cliffs]], theyâ€™ve been able to live as quiet observers to the ebb and flow of [[Evertide]]. In these millennia of quiet contemplation, they have come to learn that the only certainty in [[Evertide]] is change, and as such, they must grow and change as well. With this certainty in mind, they devote themselves to learning the unknown, grasping at the unknowable, constantly researching and growing to find the perfect route of evolution that will bring them to be one with [[The Great Torrent]]. This route is known as The Unsung Path, and as a philosophy is also popular with [[Hybrids]] and [[The Goblinoids|Goblinoids]].
